.SH NAME
helmert3d

.SH DESCRIPTION
3D Helmert transformation Tool

The 3D Helmert transformation (Xt=T+sRX) is a frequently used method in geodesy to produce transformations between different Cartesian coordinate systems.
.TP
where
 Xt = transformed coordinate vector
 X = initial coordinate vector
 T = translation vector
 R = rotation matrix including rx, ry, rz
 rx, ry, rz = rotations around the coordinate axes
 s = scale factor
